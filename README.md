# Vimderp
Easy installation and configuration of Vim to act more like a full blown version of IDEs that everyone loves.

# Installation
Git submodules are in use with this repo.  To avoid extra confusion, the recursive flag will download all the submodules when initially checking it out.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dna9186/vimderp.git $HOME/.vim
$HOME/.vim/install.sh
```
